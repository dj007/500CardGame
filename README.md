500CardGame
===========

The project will involve the development of an interactive card game called Five Hundred (a.k.a 500, or "Cinq Cent" in French). The game will pit one human player and one robot player against a team of robot players. Alternately, the game engine will also support completely automatic playing, for the purpose of testing and evaluating the skills of the robots.
